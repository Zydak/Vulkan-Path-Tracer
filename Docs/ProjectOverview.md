# Project Overview

**Disclaimer**: I describe my specific implementation choices and approach to path tracing. The mathematical formulations and techniques described here represent my interpretation and implementation of various published papers and methods. But for authoritative and complete information, please refer to the original papers. These sections also assume that you're already familiar with path tracing concepts.
