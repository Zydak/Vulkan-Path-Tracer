## Ray Tracing Pipeline
The acceleration structure for ray tracing as well as all mesh intersection tests are handled through the Vulkan RT pipeline, and that part of the code is handled by [VulkanHelper](https://github.com/Zydak/VulkanHelper). I decided to use Vulkan RT pipeline for the simplicity and performance. It allows for utilizing RT cores on the newer GPUs so it's a lot faster than doing everything in compute. And of course you don't have to set up your own acceleration structure so it's way simpler. Although I wonder if using ray queries inside a compute shader would be faster or slower. I never got to test that out. The only thing that's worth noting here is that I do loop based approach for generating rays instead of recursion (I don't spawn new rays from hit shader), I found it around 2x-3x faster. I guess the GPU doesn't like recursion. Also with loop based approach there's no depth limit. Last time I checked vulkan only guarantees that the recursion limit is at least 1, anything above that varies per GPU.
